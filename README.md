# Rust HTML Templates Web Service (Actix + Askama + tailwind)
A web service without any client-side JavaScript, but with all the DX of Rust and Tailwind! ðŸ¦€

# Running
## Local
A `.env` should be created, `.env.template` can be used as a template: `cp .env.template .env`.

The rust crate requires a postgres database to be running and named in the `.env` file (`DATABASE_URL`).

`./scripts/backend_dev.sh` can be executed to start a local postgres docker image with parameters suitable for the default `DATABASE_URL` found in `.env.template` file.

This script also requires the sqlx cli to be installed to run the migrations on the database. sqlx cli can be installed with `cargo install sqlx-cli`

With the backend running `./scripts/frontend_dev.sh` can be used to build the tailwind and begin the actix server. The web service should now be viewable on `localhost:3000`.

## Containerized
Docker compose can also be used to deploy the full stack by running `docker compose up`. Note that the `.env` file is still required for this, where secrets for JWT and Hash should be placed.
